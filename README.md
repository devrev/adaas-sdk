# Overview

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/devrev/adaas-sdk/badge.svg?branch=main&t=s4Otlm)](https://coveralls.io/github/devrev/adaas-sdk?branch=main)

The ADaaS (Airdrop-as-a-Service) Library for TypeScript helps developers build Snap-ins that integrate with DevRevâ€™s ADaaS platform. This library simplifies the workflow for handling data extraction and loading, event-driven actions, state management, and artifact handling.

It provides features such as:

- Type Definitions: Structured types for ADaaS control protocol
- Event Management: Easily emit events for different extraction or loading phases
- State Handling: Update and access state in real-time within tasks
- Artifact Management: Supports batched storage of artifacts
- Error & Timeout Support: Error handling and timeout management for long-running tasks

# Installation

```bash
npm install @devrev/ts-adaas
```
