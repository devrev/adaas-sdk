# Contributing

All changes must be made through Pull Requests. Direct commits to main or release branches are not allowed.

## Versioning

We follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for versioning, with the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- `MAJOR` - Breaking changes, incompatible API changes
- `MINOR` - New features, backward compatible
- `PATCH` - Bug fixes, no new features
