# OOM Testing Setup Summary

## Overview

I've created a comprehensive Out of Memory (OOM) testing suite for your ADaaS SDK project. This setup uses Docker containers with memory constraints and LocalStack to simulate real-world memory pressure scenarios.

## What Was Created

### üê≥ Docker Infrastructure
- **`docker-compose.oom-tests.yml`**: Orchestrates LocalStack and test runner with memory constraints
- **`Dockerfile.oom-tests`**: Custom container for running OOM tests with monitoring tools
- **Memory Limits**: LocalStack (512MB), Test Runner (384MB), Node.js heap (256MB)

### üß™ Test Suite
- **`oom-tests/oom-scenarios.test.ts`**: Comprehensive test scenarios including:
  - Gradual memory leaks through array growth
  - Rapid memory allocation bursts  
  - Circular reference memory leaks
  - LocalStack S3 upload pressure tests
  - Concurrent AWS operations
  - Worker thread memory pressure

### üîß Utilities & Configuration
- **`oom-tests/oom-test-helpers.ts`**: Test runner with memory monitoring
- **`oom-tests/types.ts`**: TypeScript interfaces for OOM testing
- **`oom-tests/jest.config.oom.cjs`**: Jest configuration for OOM tests
- **`oom-tests/jest.setup.ts`**: Global test setup with memory utilities

### üìú Scripts & Automation
- **`oom-tests/run-oom-tests.sh`**: Comprehensive test runner script with monitoring
- **`oom-tests/demo-oom.ts`**: Demonstration script showing OOM testing capabilities
- **Updated `package.json`**: Added npm scripts for running OOM tests

### üìö Documentation
- **`oom-tests/README.md`**: Comprehensive documentation and usage guide

## How to Use

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all OOM tests with Docker monitoring
npm run test:oom:docker

# Or use the script directly
./oom-tests/run-oom-tests.sh
```

### Available Commands
```bash
# Run OOM tests locally (without Docker)
npm run test:oom

# Setup Docker environment without running tests
npm run test:oom:setup

# Cleanup Docker containers
npm run test:oom:cleanup

# Run demo to see OOM testing in action
npx ts-node oom-tests/demo-oom.ts
```

## Key Features

### üéØ Memory Constraint Testing
- **Containerized Environment**: Isolated testing with strict memory limits
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track memory usage during test execution
- **Multiple Scenarios**: Test different memory allocation patterns

### üå©Ô∏è LocalStack Integration
- **AWS Service Simulation**: Test S3, DynamoDB, Lambda operations under memory pressure
- **Realistic Workloads**: Upload large files, concurrent operations
- **Service Health Monitoring**: Ensure LocalStack remains responsive

### üìä Comprehensive Monitoring
- **Memory Snapshots**: Track memory usage over time
- **Container Statistics**: Monitor Docker container resource usage
- **Event Logging**: Capture Docker events during tests
- **Detailed Reports**: Generate markdown reports with test results

### üßπ Robust Cleanup
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Clean up containers and resources after tests
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling with detailed logging
- **Garbage Collection**: Force GC between tests when available

## Memory Scenarios Tested

1. **Gradual Memory Leaks**: Slowly growing arrays with large objects
2. **Rapid Allocation**: Quick allocation of large memory chunks
3. **Circular References**: Objects with circular refs preventing GC
4. **File Upload Pressure**: Large file uploads to LocalStack S3
5. **Concurrent Operations**: Multiple simultaneous AWS operations
6. **Worker Thread Pressure**: Memory allocation in worker threads

## Output & Reporting

All test artifacts are stored in `./oom-test-logs/`:
- `test-output.log`: Complete test execution output
- `monitor.log`: Container monitoring data
- `docker-events.log`: Docker events timeline
- `final-stats.log`: Final container statistics
- `oom-test-report.md`: Comprehensive test report

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/aws-sdk": "^2.7.0",
    "aws-sdk": "^2.1691.0",
    "jest-junit": "^16.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install new dependencies
2. **Test the Setup**: Run `npx ts-node oom-tests/demo-oom.ts` for a quick demo
3. **Run Full Tests**: Execute `npm run test:oom:docker` for complete testing
4. **Customize Scenarios**: Modify `oom-scenarios.test.ts` for your specific needs
5. **Integrate CI/CD**: Add OOM tests to your CI pipeline

## Safety Features

- **Isolated Containers**: Tests run in isolated Docker containers
- **Memory Limits**: Strict memory constraints prevent system impact
- **Timeouts**: Tests have timeouts to prevent hanging
- **Cleanup Scripts**: Automatic cleanup of all test artifacts
- **No Real AWS**: Uses LocalStack, no real AWS resources needed

## Troubleshooting

- **Container OOM**: Increase memory limits in docker-compose file
- **LocalStack Issues**: Check health endpoint and increase startup timeout
- **Port Conflicts**: Ensure ports 4566, 4510-4559 are available
- **Permission Issues**: Ensure Docker daemon is running and accessible

This OOM testing suite provides a robust foundation for testing memory-related issues in your ADaaS SDK under realistic conditions with proper monitoring and reporting.
